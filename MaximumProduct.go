/*
Maximum Product Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
